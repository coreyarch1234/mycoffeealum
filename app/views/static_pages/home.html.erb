            <p class='header-paragraph'>Our mission is simple. We want to give college undergraduates
                the opportunity to meet alumni and upperclassmen who can offer invaluable experiential
                advice about what paths are out there. This can range from insights into what the best
                classes are to which majors offer the best jobs.
